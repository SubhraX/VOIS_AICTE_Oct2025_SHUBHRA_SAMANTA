# Airbnb NYC Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter / Google Colab analysis of Airbnb listings in New York City. It performs data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations to answer the following research questions:

1. What are the different property / room types in the dataset?  
2. Which neighborhood group has the highest number of listings?  
3. Which neighborhood groups have the highest average prices?  
4. Is there a relationship between construction year (or year features) and listing price?  
5. Who are the top 10 hosts by listing count?  
6. Are hosts with verified identities more likely to receive positive reviews?  
7. Is there a correlation between listing price and service fee?  
8. What is the average review (rating) for listings, and how does it vary by neighborhood group and room type?  
9. Are hosts with more listings more likely to maintain higher availability throughout the year?
